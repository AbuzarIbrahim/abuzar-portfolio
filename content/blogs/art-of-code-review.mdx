Code reviews are more than just catching bugs—they're opportunities for knowledge sharing, mentorship, and building better software together.

## Beyond Bug Hunting

While finding issues is important, the best code reviews focus on knowledge transfer, consistency, and learning opportunities for both reviewer and author.

## The Reviewer's Mindset

### Ask Questions, Don't Make Demands

Instead of "This is wrong. Use map instead," try "Could we use map here? It might be more readable and functional. What do you think about this approach?"

### Focus on the Code, Not the Person

Rather than "You always forget to handle edge cases," say "Let's add a test case for when the array is empty."

### Provide Context


## The Author's Approach

### Self-Review First

Before requesting review, go through your own code: Are variable names clear? Is the logic easy to follow? Are there adequate tests? Does it follow team conventions?

### Provide Context

Help reviewers understand your decisions:


## Review Checklist

### Functionality
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Are error conditions managed appropriately?

### Readability
- Is the code self-documenting?
- Are variable and function names descriptive?
- Is the logic easy to follow?

### Performance & Security
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Are inputs validated and sanitized?
- Are authentication and authorization handled correctly?

## Tools and Automation

Let tools handle the mechanical aspects:

## Building a Review Culture

Lead by example, make it safe to ask questions and admit mistakes, celebrate good reviews, and conduct regular retrospectives to discuss what's working and what isn't.

Great code reviews are an investment in your team's growth and your codebase's health. The goal isn't perfect code—it's better code, better understanding, and a better team.
