Performance isn't just about making things fast—it's about creating inclusive, accessible experiences that work for everyone, regardless of their device or network conditions.

## The Cost of Poor Performance

Poor performance has real business impact: 1 second delay equals 7% reduction in conversions, 3 second load time means 32% of users will leave, and mobile users are 5x more likely to abandon slow sites.

But beyond metrics, poor performance excludes users with slower devices and limited data plans.

## Core Web Vitals: The New Standard

Google's Core Web Vitals provide measurable metrics for user experience:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

Measures loading performance. Aim for under 2.5 seconds.


### First Input Delay (FID)

Measures interactivity. Target under 100 milliseconds.


### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

Measures visual stability. Keep under 0.1.


## Performance Budget

Establish performance budgets early:


## Optimization Strategies

### Critical Resource Optimization

1. **Inline critical CSS** for above-the-fold content
2. **Defer non-critical JavaScript**
3. **Optimize images** with modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
4. **Use CDN** for static assets

### Modern Loading Patterns


## Monitoring and Measurement

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)

Synthetic testing is important, but real user data tells the complete story:

## Tools and Techniques

Use Lighthouse for comprehensive audits, WebPageTest for detailed analysis, Chrome DevTools for debugging, and bundle analyzers for understanding code splits.

Performance-first development isn't about premature optimization—it's about making conscious decisions that prioritize user experience from the start. Remember: Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.
